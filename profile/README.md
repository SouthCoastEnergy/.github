## Contributing to the Energy Revolution ⚡️🔋

Some energy sector companies will not be our greatest supporters; this is the case of many revolution attempts in every sector.
We contribute to the tools 🔧 we rely on to build and run South Coast Energy while maintaining 🧙‍♂️ our own open-source projects.
Some of you, like South Coast Energy, may build closed or open-source software you would like to pitch to energy companies.
Be prepared for rejections and hard passes on what may feel like your software baby from companies across our World.
Know that South Coast Energy will consider any contribution and our software. Our legacy is as important as the work we do today.
Energy secures the survival of homo sapiens; whether it be [the fire keeping our Neanderthal ancestors warm up to 400,000 years ago](https://www.sapiens.org/archaeology/neanderthal-fire) or the latest photovoltaic panels providing 1200 Watts of electrical energy.
We strive for greater openness in an already opportunistic industry.

## Docs 🤓📚

Our open-source software documentation will always be open-source.
We privatise some of our infrastructure documentation; however, some of this will be generalised to provide open-source infrastructure case studies, documentation, infographics or
